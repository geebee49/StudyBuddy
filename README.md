# StudyBuddy

The Online class era hasnt gone easy on a student's life. This is an application that helps students to organise their time schedule and manage their assignments and other workload.

<h2>What it does?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Allows the students to set their time table and the app gives out reminders when the class starts.</li>
  <li> As to whether you have attended the class or not, the app tracks your attendance.</li>
  <li> To-do list of assignments and gentle reminders</li>
  <li> Exam schedule reminders </li>
  </ol>

<h2> Working </h2>
The idea of the app is that it should act like a buddy who helps the student manage their work properly by giving out reminders of the work he/she is supposed to do. Since its like a friend the communication between the app and the user will be in an informal language. The app has a user log in so that the data is stored with respect to the account. The student is able to set the time table at the beginning, inputting the subjects and the time of these classes. Students can also add their assignments to the app and the application gives a gentle reminder of the pending assignments. There is also a slot for adding your upcoming exam schedules.
